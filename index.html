This article explores the mechanisms deployed in precision machines used to mitigate the effect that heat has on them to give them their ability to reliably hold drastically tighter tolerances than standard machine tools. The increasing demands of accuracy from these machines come from the evolving designs and scientific breakthroughs that require components produced to degree of accuracy that is hard to conceptualise.

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <pre id="Introduction_InText", class="ex1">
Sub-micron accuracy is defined as a possible tolerance bellow 1 micrometre (µm) and is where precision machines are used to repeatably achieve these hard requirements needed for the component they manufacture to preform how they were intended to. Parts produced from these machines are critical to many industries including airspace, optics, semiconductors manufacturing and energy where the sub-micron tolerances are required to improve performance, reliability and ensure safety <a href="#References">(Hoffman and Zhang, 2018)</a>. It is thought that 70% of geometrical error in CNC (computer numerically controlled) machines is from thermal destruction on the machine. These thermal errors come from ambient temperature fluctuations and heat generated from components from the machine which includes their motors, electronics and areas where friction occurs. Heat from these sources causes thermal expansion within that machine causing dimensional drift Thermal expansion within a machine will change the tools position relativeto the workpiece. It is hard to predict how uneven temperature changes will change the shape as it can cause the machines not just to grow linearly but also distort.

  <pre id="Material_selection_InText", class="ex1">
Materials with a low thermal expansion are used to reduce the effect from temperature changes has on the machine from meat generated from the machine but also the environment around it. (Mayr et al., 2012) A commonly used material for hight precision machines is granite not just becauseof it’s excellent thermal stability but has other desirable characteristics including stability, rigidity, wear resistance and an ability to absorb vibrations. An alternative to granite are epoxy granite bases that matches many of the characteristics all whilst being significantly cheaper. Unlike granite that requires to be machined from solid slabs into their desired form, epoxy granite is cast in moulds where wiring and coolant conduits are easily included. Surfaces can be ground, resulting in considerably cheaper bases without the lengthy lead times to get hard to find granite slabs. 
      
However, castings mouldes need to be made so this only suits machines made in medium to large quantities and does not allow modifications to be easily made.(McKeown and Morgan, 1979)
      
There is problem with both granite and epoxy granite. The first is being that from their extremely slow thermal conductivity, heat travels slowly around the base causing hot spots near motors that then take a long time to disperse. The other concerns their heterogeneous makeup meaning their properties can vary drastically. This is not just between different bases but also within the same slab from the mixture of different minerals unevenly distributed. These can cause the machine to have uneven expansion within its self causing unwanted stresses. This makes the machine extremely difficult to predict how it will move when it experience different temperatures across the frame of the machine. 
      
To combat this a new approach has been constructed that goes against systems with a slow response to temperature fluctuations in the surrounding areas from a low thermal conductivity. It uses materials like aluminium with high thermal conductivity and low thermal capacity meaning the system is able to respond quickly to thermal change. When the system is unevenly thermally loaded the system have a very homogenous temperature distribution. This means it acts in avery predictable way so the model for temperature compensation is simple and more accurate. Also when coolant is pumped around the machine body it doesn’t create large temperature gradients across the system. The coolant removes any temperature from the system quickly because of its high specific heat capacity(Fritz and Janitza, 2013).

  <pre id="Design_optimisation_InText">
When designing a precision machine tool manufacturers first try use components that will produce as little thermal energy as possible where motors can’t be removed only made more efficient this is done by using components like hydrostatic ways and air bearings. These use pressurised air and oil to take the weight rather than any physical contact found in regular bearings, this significantly reduces the friction both helping with thermal stability and accuracy.(Huang and Yang, 2022) The next thing designers try to do is to isolate any heat generating components from the base of the machine so the thermal energy isn’t being emitted into the base. This can be done with servo amplifiers, auxiliary pumps and chiller unites so any thermal energy isn’t put into the casting. This can be done with separate cabinets or by mounting these components on an isolated board away from the main body. The components that can’t beisolated from the body of the machine like the spindle and motors need to be distributed around the machine so it is thermally symmetrical. This means thermal energy is distributed evenly across the machine so it grows evenly and more predictable minimising the possible temperature gradients (Li et al., 2021).

  <pre id="Real_time_compensation_InText">
Another way precision machines are able extract more accuracy from themselves is by using a thermal models to predict how they will move when different thermal loads are exposed to different areas of the machine. This is done by strategically placing temperature and displacement sensors around the machine in areas where thermal change most affect the geometry the machine, these then feed data into models (Naumann et al., 2024). There are a variety of models have been made deriving from different mathematical methods including least square method, multivariable regression analysis, Grey system, neural network, support vector machine and hybrid model(Li et al., 2021). However none of these methods have been found to be 100% accurate at predicting how the machines will react so work continues to fine better method.

  <p class="ex1">
  <pre id="Conclusion _InText">
Thermal distortion is a massive hurdle for cnc machines achieving sub-micron accuracy. Each of the developments I have looked into all play a small but noticeable roll in reducing the error when implemented into the design of precision machines. As these technologies have been developed for high precision they get filtered down into making every day machines more accurate, this is particularly true for real time compensation as even simple models can improve accuracy quite significantly.
